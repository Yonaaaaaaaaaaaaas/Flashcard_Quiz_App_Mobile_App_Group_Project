# Flashcard App

Target Audience: Students

Our Flashcard app is an educational app designed to help students learn and reinforce knowledge through flashcard quizzes. It provides two main buisness features:
  1) Create and maintain flashcards:
          
       Students can create custom flashcards, by writing the questions and answer for any subject.
  2) Create and maintain study sessions

       A "study session" is a scheduled or on-demand review of flashcards, tailored to the userâ€™s goals.

Other features:

1) It can group flashcards into decks.

2) Decks can be grouped into a folder and folders can in turn be grouped into folders and so on.

3) The tests can be given randomly or in sequence.

4) It can archive flashcards so that already finished courses/subjects do not take up visual space.

5) It has a streak feature to help keep learners engaged.
